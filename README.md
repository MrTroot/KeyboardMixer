# KeyboardMixer
KeyboardMixer allows you to change specific application volumes using keyboard volume controls.

You can also add two custom applications to change the volume of, which will trigger when holding Ctrl+Shift or Ctrl+Alt respectively. To change these, add the name of the application's .exe file into the text field as shown.
